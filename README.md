# video-server
Video server for downloaded videos like TV recordings (see [video-dl](https://github.com/vogler/video-dl)).

Why?
1. Experiment with player features I'd like to have for every video
2. Not everything is available on YouTube
3. Media servers like [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin), [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) etc. work fine for Movies/Shows, but are pretty slow or not ideal for random video files.

Goals:

- List videos in folder with thumbnail
- Track what was watched (incl. which regions of a video) per user
- Player features like YouTube
  - Thumbnails on progress bar
  - Generated closed captions / subtitles
  - Keyboard shortcuts (arrows, j/k/l)
  - Adjust preferred playback speed
- Advanced player features
  - Skip intro/outro, pauses
  - Skip ads
    - [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) for YouTube
    - [YouTV](https://www.youtv.de/) has markers for ads in their UI
  - Show clickable transcript like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
  - Show waveform like [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/)
  - Show played time ranges like on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/)
  - Adjust speed by spoken wpm
- Search/organization
  - Search transcripts of all all (watched) videos ([example](https://github.com/cmf/huberman) using `yt-dlp`)
  - YouTube
    - Statistics of (not) watched videos: time left to watch, how much time per day, how much time saved by speedup, how much time skipped etc., maybe play around with data for improving recommendations
    - Better sorting/filtering/statistics of video lists
    - Group similar videos by meta-data (length, title, description, category) or even content from transcript
